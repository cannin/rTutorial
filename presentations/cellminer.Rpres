Topics to be Covered
===
* Introduction to CellMiner
* Introduction to rcellminer

What is CellMiner?
===
class: smaller-75 

* Website: 
 * http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer
* Retrieval and integration for NCI-60 datasets: molecular and pharmacological
* NCI-60
 * 60 human cancer cell lines from 9 tissues of origin: breast, central nervous system, colon, leukemia, melanoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, prostate, and renal
 * Used by the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute to screen over 100,000 chemical compounds and natural products
* A subset of ~21,000 drugs is provided by CellMiner 
* Drug activity levels expressed as 50% growth-inhibitory levels (GI50) were determined at 48 hours using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
 * Determines cell density based on the measurement of total cellular protein content
 
What is rcellminer?
===
class: smaller 

* Website and Tutorial (Vignette):
 * https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rcellminer.html
* Publication: 
 * http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635141
* Provides programmatic access to CellMiner NCI-60 data
* Data Types
 * Gene and protein expression, copy number, whole exome mutations, etc
 * Activity data for ~21K compounds and information on their structure, mechanism of action, and repeat screens
* Easy visualization of compound structures, activity patterns, and molecular feature profiles
* Embedded R Shiny applications allow interactive data exploration

Embedded Shiny Applications
===
* Simplified web applications to do common data exploration tasks
 * Compare any two molecular and drug profiles 
 * Find related structures 
 * View information on repeat screening for drug compounds
